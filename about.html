<p>Welcome to the UNCG College Democrats organizing site. We hope you take advantage of the resources available, to strive for a Democratic majority in our General Assembly by 2016. The UNCG College Democrats have existed since 1976, working for voter registration and progressive reform on our campus. This year, we're going the extra step. We're training our members and giving them the tools we need to lead local campaigns to victory.</p>

<p>The Tea Party dominated legislature is working rapidly to demolish 100 years of progress. Help us stop them before it's too late.</p>

<p><strong>Progressive. Political. Passionate.</strong>  We are the UNCG College Democrats.</p></div>
